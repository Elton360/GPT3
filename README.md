### Installation & Running steps

The easiest way to get started is to install install Node.js. You can do that by going to :

```
https://nodejs.org/en/.
```

This will automatically install the Node Package Manager (NPM).

It is also necessary to be able to run git commands in your terminal (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), or use the dektop app (https://desktop.github.com/).

After Node.js is installed, and you can run git commands/or the app, you will need to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```

git clone https://github.com/Elton360/GPT3 or use the Desktop App by going to File, then clone repository.

```

Using your terminal, You can now install all the necessary dependencies for the node_modules folder by navigating to the directory folder, and running :

```

npm install

```

It is necessary to have the API key, which is a file that should be plced in the src folder.
This key cannot be found in the repository for security reason, Openai will update it if it is found in an online repository.

The app can now be started on your local machine by running:

```

npm start

```
